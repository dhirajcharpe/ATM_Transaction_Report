Scope of the project:
The data analytics project will involve analyzing the ATM transactions data, which includes the Transactions fact table, Location dimension table, Customers Dimension table, Transaction Type Dimension Table, Hour dimension table, and Calendar dimension. The analysis will involve data cleaning, data transformation, and data visualization using Excel/Power BI.

Project Objective:
Create Power BI dashboard for a Bank transaction to provide valuable insights into transaction amount, transaction Count, Utilization rate and other metrics. Utilize various visualization to offer a clear view of the bank’s performance, identify trends and support data- driven decision making.
Procedure Followed:
◾ Extract data: The data was received from the client in Excel format.
◾ Transform data: Load the data in Power Bi and further, the data was cleaned by Removing null, and duplicate values, Adding New Column, rectifying spelling errors and data types in Power Query.
◾ Load data: The transformed data was loaded into Power View for further analysis.
◾ Data Modelling: The data modelling process was undertaken to create a logical structure for the data, enabling it to be analyzed and visualized effectively
◾ Writing DAX: The data was further refined using the Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) language to create calculated measures and calculated columns for advanced analysis
◾ Report Building: Once the data was prepared, the dashboard was built with a focus on creating intuitive, user-friendly reports and visualizations
◾ Publish Report: Finally, the dashboard was published on Power BI Service, allowing the client to easily access the data and insights. A comprehensive report of insights and recommendations was submitted.

Business Requirements:
·      Analyze the ATM transaction data and generate reports and visualizations that show the most popular ATM locations and transaction types by time of day, day of week, and month.
·      Calculate the average transaction amount per customer and per ATM location.
·      Analyze the number of transactions and transaction amounts by customer age group, gender, and occupation.

Expected deliverables:
The expected deliverables from the data analytics project are a set of reports and dashboards that provide insights and answers to the business problem questions. The reports and dashboards should be interactive and user-friendly, and should enable the Banking team to make data-driven decisions that improve customer experience and optimize operations.

Conclusion:
Power Bi dashboard will help the bank to understand its ATM transactions data and improve its operations. The external consultant will work closely with the Bank team to ensure that the project is successful and delivers the expected results.
